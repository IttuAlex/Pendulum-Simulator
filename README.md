# Pendulum Simulator

This is a project developed for the **Faculty of Automation and Computers**, as part of a **Systems Dynamics** course. The project simulates the behavior of a pendulum under the influence of an additional weight attached to it. The main goal of this project is to understand how potential energy changes when the additional weight is placed on the pendulum and how it affects the motion and stability of the system.

## Description

In this simulation, a simple pendulum is modeled, and an additional weight (with variable mass and length) is attached to it. The project calculates how gravitational forces act on the pendulum and how the potential energy changes based on the pendulum's position and motion.

### Key Components of the System:

- **Pendulum**: Has a constant length and mass.
- **Additional weight**: A weight attached to the pendulum that can be moved over a variable distance and can alter the pendulum's behavior.
- **Motion simulation**: The pendulum's movement is determined by gravitational forces and the interaction between the additional weight and the pendulum.

The simulation is displayed graphically, with a **canvas** for visualizing the pendulum's motion and an interactive **graph** showing changes in potential energy over time.

## Features

- Visualization of the pendulum's motion on a 2D canvas.
- Control over the initial position of the additional weight and the pendulum's angle.
- Buttons to start, stop, and reset the simulation.
- Interactive graph displaying potential energy over time.
- Direct interaction with the simulation via sliders for adjusting parameters (mass, length, angle).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** and **CSS** for page structure and design.
- **JavaScript** for the simulation logic and user interaction.
- **Plotly.js** for generating the interactive potential energy graph.
